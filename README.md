# bot-roster
A React app that allows users to build a team roster. I built this intentionally without Redux to reaquaint myself with prop-drilling. I found the content-editable feature tricky and ended up using a bit of DOM manipulation to force some rendering. I plan to use this project to learn how to implement Draft.js to refactor the content-editable feature.
